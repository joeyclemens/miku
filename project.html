		<h2>The Nixie clock</h2>
		
		<h3>The brief</h3>
			<p>I have been fascinated with the idea of having a nixie tube clock ever 
			since I first saw one. I had seen a few online but was amazed at how much 
			they cost to buy. After a few eBay searches I soon realised I could get the 
			tubes themselves for relatively cheap and looked into how difficult it might 
			be to build one myself.</p>

	<h3>The build</h3>
	<p>There are a few schematics online that explain how the tubes work and using this 
	I was able to get the tubes I bought to display numbers. The next step was how to get 
	the time displayed as accurately as possible. I have used the Arduino micro 
	controller a few times before, so I was familiar with it and its programming language.
	I used one as a base for this project and worked upwards from there. I found a cheap 
	circuit board online with a 555 timer and the required voltage regulators 
	(The nixie tubes need 240 volts which is considerably more than the 5 volts the 
	Arduino outputs). Once everything was soldered together and the code was written I 
	was very pleased to see that it worked. I then had to put it in a box of some kind. 
	The bare circuit board looked cool but if you touched it there was a very good chance 
	of a nasty electric shock. I settled on a nice wooden box which I felt offset the 
	steampunk feel of the orange glow from the tubes. </p>
