		 <p>I have been fascinated with the idea of having a nixie tube clock ever 
			since I first saw one. I had seen a few online but was amazed at how much 
			they cost to buy. After a few eBay searches I soon realised I could get the 
			tubes themselves for relatively cheap and looked into how difficult it might 
			be to build one myself.</p>

	<p>The next project to be added here will be the restoration of a Macintosh Classic ii computer. It came to me with
	power issues and no hard drive or software. Hopefully a simple recap will restore it to its former glory.

<h5><u>20/08/19</u></h5>
<p>I designed and built this website as a creative exercise. I wanted to learn
how to do it and i've always found the best way to learn something is by
hands on experience. I was surprised to find how simple it was, and yet I keep
finding new tricks to improve the layout. Its somewhat addictive and im looking 
forward to seeing what I can come up with next. </p>
